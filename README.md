# About
This project is a performance focused .NET Library for serializing key value files. 
These files are commonly found when working with configuring video games or other applications that have human readable setting files that allow users to change the configuration through a text file.

# Mission
Creating a high-performance and low allocation key value UTF8 serializer that can be customized without code changes. 

# Why
For my personal projects I needed a way to serialize key value files with support for values that could span multiple lines and would deserialize into static objects.
